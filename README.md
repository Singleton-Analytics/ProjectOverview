## Overview
Diagnosing cancer has always been a difficult task for mankind, and throughout its history it has been entrusted to the medical industry to pursue its solution. Nowadays, however, and with the advancement in the applications of artificial intelligence technology, it is becoming increasingly vital to break into the healthcare industry through its most difficult and crucial issues viz. cancer [Diagnostics, Monitoring].
This is how the [SIIM-ISIC-Melanoma-Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification) competition started, it is one of the world's largest competitions on cancer prediction using artificial intelligence and data science, applying the latest technological advances [AI, Machine Learning, Data Science] combined with the exclusive medical knowledge [high quality microscopic images, cellular data and description], we have designed our solution to be technologically viable and medically suitable, however, our approach has sparked a general interest from competition organizers and the data science community, which led to the formation of Singleton Analytics, a startup to diagnose cancer using artificial intelligence.

##  Context

Every year, pathologists diagnose 14 million new cancer patients worldwide. These are millions of people who will face years of uncertainty.
Pathologists have been making cancer diagnoses and prognoses for decades. Most pathologists have a 96-98% success rate in diagnosing cancer. They are pretty good at it.
The problem comes in the next part. According to the Oslo University Hospital, prognosis accuracy is only 60% for pathologists. A prognosis is the part of a biopsy that occurs after cancer is diagnosed; it helps predict the development of the disease.
It is time for the next step to be taken in pathology.
### A new approach
The next step in pathology is machine learning.
Machine learning (ML) is one of the main branches of artificial intelligence. It is a system that takes data, finds patterns, trains using the data and produces a result.
So what makes a machine better than a skilled professional?
ML has key advantages over pathologists.
First, machines can run much faster than humans. A biopsy usually takes 10 days for a pathologist. A computer can take thousands of biopsies in seconds.
Singleton Analytics understood this and combined the power of AI with proprietary cancer medical data to implement an out-of-the-box solution.

## Background

The idea of this this platform was a result of the collaboration between me, Mohamed Mostapha, Software Engineer and my colleague Elkhait Meine, Data Scientist. Indeed, a few months ago we participated in a competition on the classification of cancer [SIIM-ISIC-Melanoma-Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification) on the [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/), the largest community dedicated to Data Science. The objective of this competition was to detect the potential presence of melanoma in images of skin lesions. In the first session, we got the 32nd position out of a total of more than 4000 teams around the world. Following these results, we were contacted by a South African company inviting us to an effective collaboration to help them refine their diagnosis.
The results of this first attempt encouraged us to continue our research in this area in order to be able to make our contribution.

# Section 2 : Cancer in Mauritania

In this part, we will discuss the statistics provided by the International Agency for Research on Cancer - World Health Organization (WHO) concerning the number of cancer cases in Mauritania in 2020 and the estimates over the last five years (2016 - 2020).

#### Number of new cases

### Incidence, mortality and prevalence

In 2020, there were 3,079 new cases of cancer in Mauritania with a different distribution for each of the cancers, breast cancer being the most common with 521 cases. Over the past five years, the number of prevalent cases is estimated at 5,480 cases. We can see that the number of new cases seems to explode each year, representing an increase of about 56% compared to the number of prevalent cases over the last five years. We also see that the distribution of cancers depends on the sex of the patients and that the distribution of the number of cases is very different from cancer to cancer.

## Singleton Analytics Focus Group
We have conducted intensive focus group interviews with a number of physicians specializing in cancer and related diseases
Interviews were conducted at different times and locations and the table below summarizes the average responses we got
Doctors interviewed: Dr Lala Dahan - general practitioner at the National Oncology Center
Dr Salma Yahya - specialist in skin diseases
For personal reasons, some doctors have not allowed us to share their identity

Focus Group
Singleton Analytics

Question 1:
How is cancer diagnosis and monitoring done (internationally and in Mauritania)?

Notes:

- What types of cancer can be diagnosed?
- Are all cancers diagnosed the same way?


Common Responses:

Clinical diagnosis:
   Dark spot, bleeding, characteristics for skin cancer
- Biopsy request
- Immuno-labeling to determine the exact type of cancer (not available in Mauritania)
TV dermatology

Question 2:
What are the difficulties encountered and the limits of the current diagnosis?

Common Responses:
Pathology: difficult to detect for some cancers, few resources
Clinical: diagnosis takes a long time (1 to 2 months), not many specialists


Note: The list of questions is too long to add here, we have included only the most important questions. The other questions are available in doc format and can be viewed upon request.
